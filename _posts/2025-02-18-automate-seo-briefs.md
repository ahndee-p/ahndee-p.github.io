In this video I'll walk you through how to create a dashboard in Airtable that will automate your local SEO content brief creation process. We'll use a webhook to trigger an automation in Make.com that:

1) pulls the top competitors subheadings using Perplexity 
2) finds topic gaps and combines them with the competitor subheadings to create an outline 
3) adds ideas to make your content hyperlocal 
4) adds unique expert angles that improve E-A-T-T

Finally, we'll combine everything into a content brief using a Google Doc Template and add a link to the finished product in your Airtable.
