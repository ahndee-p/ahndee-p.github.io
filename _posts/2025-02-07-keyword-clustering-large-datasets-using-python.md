In this video I go over my approach to using machine learning models like BERT and K-Means Clustering to semantically cluster over 5,000 keywords into topics that can be turned into blog posts. We start by generating a list of low competition keywords that other competitors are already ranking for and then use a CoLab notebook to execute the python code. Enjoy!
