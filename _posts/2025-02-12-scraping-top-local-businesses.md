In this video I show you the right way to do competitive research for local SEO. We'll use an automation tool called Make.com and a web scraping tool called Apify to scrape the Google SERPS for the top 5 websites ranking for terms like "dentist in {city}". Once you have your list of websites you can further analyze them to see what the best dentist websites across the US are doing for backlinks, site speed, tech platform, etc.
