Content Remixer is the first project I created while taking Nat Eliason’s course on building your own apps with AI coding. 

The app itself is nothing special; what gets me excited is the skills I’ve gained through the course in rapidly prototyping ideas for fully functioning web apps. 

I’ve tried learning to code many times on my own before the rise of AI code editors like Cursor. 
Inevitably I’d always abandon it because I wasn’t building anything useful or intriguing. 

AI-assisted coding has been a complete game changer and after taking this course I finally feel comfortable with so many aspects of programming that blocked my progress in the past like:

- How to get an IDE setup
- How to use the terminal
- How to work with GitHub repositories
- How to work with a node project and use npm
- How to deploy to a project to a local dev server
- How does a basic React app work?
- How to use LLMs through API requests
- How to connect a database to a web app

Of course, Cursor is doing most of the heavy lifting by writing all of the code and creating my file structures; I’m just prompting it and giving it direction.

 > Yet even in that limited capacity, having a front row seat to an expert AI programmer creating my project step-by-step has helped me digest 10x more practical coding knowledge than I ever got in all of my years of taking Javascript courses combined,
 
In this course, I’m using Cursor to build web apps but there are so many other directions I could see myself taking this newfound skillset in the SEO world. 

I could use it to deploy data science models in python, create WordPress plugins that provide missing functionality, finally I can improve productivity by building scripts that automate repetitive work. 

As an idea guy who was always frustrated by having to hit UpWork to see my ideas come to life, learning to code using AI-assisted editors has opened up a world of creativity that has reinvigorated my passion for digital products and tech in general. 

P.S. this website was built with my newfound skills using a static site generator called Jekyll. I write all my blog posts in markdown, it’s blazing fast and best of all I pay ZERO dollars for hosting since I can use GitHub pages now to host my project sites for free.
